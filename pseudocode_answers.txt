**Short Answer
1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?
A: Programmers use pseudocode because it is a detailed description of the process or steps of a computer program or algorithm in a specific programming language.

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
A: It would not work and user would get error since pseudocode is intended only for human reading instead of machine reading thus makes not possible for a computer to read the code.

**Programming Assignment
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
A:  SET a function num(x,y)
       RETURN Math.max WITH (x,y)

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
A:  FOR index is equal to one and index less than or equal to 100
       INCREMENT index
    RETURN index
    FOREND 


3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
A:  INPUT phoneBookList
    SET a function filterName(list)
        RETURN phoneBookList.filter with a function li RETURNING li.toLowerCase().index(list.toLowerCase()) greater than negative one


4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.
A: It returns error since computer is not able to read it.
