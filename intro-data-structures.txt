Exercises
1.	A line of people at an amusement park ride.

The line is composed of members, represented as strings.
There is a front to the line, as well as a back.
When someone enters the line, place them at the end.
People may leave the line whenever they see fit, and those behind them take their place.
Given the above real-world information, use an array data structure to code the following solution.

a)	Use an array input: ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"]
b)	Insert a new person, "Mary" at the end of the line. In other words, you should insert Mary after Mike.
A:
var array = ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"];
array.push(“Mary”)

c)	Find a person in line named "Josh." This function should return the position of 2 in the array, (recall that arrays are 0-based).
A:
var array = ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"];
array.indexOf(“Josh”)

d)	Find a person in line named "Emily." What should your function return if it does not find the item in the array?
A:
It should return -1 since Emily does not exist on the array.

e)	What if Ava wants to allow a friend, "Melissa", to cut in line in front of her? How would you code this so Melissa appears before Ava?
A:
var array = ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"]
array.splice(1,0,"Mellisa")

f)	If Patrick wants to leave the line, how would you delete him from the array?
A:
var array = ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"];
var user = "Josh";
array.filter(item => item !== user)

or 

var array = ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"]
array.splice(2,1)

2.	Provide another real-world example that you can model using a data structure.
A:
You can use this model of data structure on keeping a record such as medical records on hospitals where patient keeps adding and be deleted on a list and records are being modified all the time.

3.	How would your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
A:
My data structure would allow developers to access and modify the list on the array which they could add more names on the list and delete them and would be able to insert names as well. I think developers should be able to do that on all kind or all models of data structures since that is what its built for.
